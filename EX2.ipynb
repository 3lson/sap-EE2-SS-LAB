    "## Lab Exercise\n",
    "Let us start by thinking about the sampling process in the time domain as shown in Fig. 2.1. It may be interpreted as the multiplication between a continuous-time domain signal $x(t)$ and a train of impulses $s(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ex2_1.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"900\"/>\n",
    "<center>Figure 2.1: The sampling process of an continuous-time signal</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that $x_s(t) = x(t)\\times s(t) = \\sum_n x(nT)\\delta(t-nT),$ where $-\\infty < n < \\infty$ and $T=1/f_s$. This is still a continuous-time signal (variable $t$) which are zero-valued for $t \\neq nT$ and should not be confused with the discrete-time signal $x[n]$, which comprises the signal amplitudes at the sampling instances and only exists for $n=0,1,2,\\cdots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about $x(t)$ and $s(t)$ and their frequency domain representations which are shown in Fig. 2.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ex2_2.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"900\"/>\n",
    "<center>Figure 2.2: Frequency domain representation of $x(t)$ and $s(t)$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that multiplication in the time domain is equivalent to convolution in the frequency domain. Therefore, the dual of $x_s(t) =x(t) \\times s(t)$ in the time domain is $X_s(j\\omega) = X(j\\omega) * S(j\\omega)$ in the frequency domain, where '$*$' denotes the linear convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $X_s(j\\omega)$ is a periodic function of frequency $\\omega$, consisting of the sum of shifted and scaled replicas of $X(j\\omega)$, shifted by integer multiples of $\\omega_s$ and scaled by $\\frac{1}{T}$. \n",

    "### Sampling Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling, therefore, has the effect of creating spectral images at each and every integer multiple of $\\omega_s$. Thus, to avoid corruption of information arising from overlapping spectral images (this distortion is called aliasing), the following condition must be met: \n",

    "$$|\\omega_m|  < \\frac{\\omega_s}{2} \\: \\text{(Nyquist frequency)}, \\quad \\text{where } \\omega_s  =2\\pi f_s =2\\pi/T_s \\quad \\implies \\quad |\\Omega|  < \\pi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency $\\omega_s/2$ is called the Nyquist frequency. If $\\omega_m$ is the highest frequency component in the signal, then sampling at a rate (frequency) above twice the maximum signal frequency, $\\omega_s>|2\\omega_m|$, is called *oversampling*. Sampling at a rate below twice this signal frequency, $\\omega_s<|2\\omega_m|$, is called *undersampling*. Lastly, sampling at a rate exactly twice this maximum signal frequency, $\\omega_s=|2\\omega_m|$, is called *critical sampling*.\n",
